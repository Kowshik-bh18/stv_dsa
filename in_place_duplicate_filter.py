#problem statement
'''
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

#solution

class Solution:
    def check(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        is_s = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if(nums[i+1]<nums[i]):
                is_s+=1
        if(nums[0]<nums[-1]):
            is_s+=1
        if is_s<=1:
            return True
        return False


#logical intuition

'''
Intuition 💡:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. Return the new length of the array after removal.

Approach & Step-by-Step Visualization🔍:
The code starts iterating from i = 1 because we need to compare each element with its previous element to check for duplicates.

1 . Initialize j = 1 (first unique element is already at nums[0]).

2 . Loop from i = 1 to end:

If nums[i] != nums[i-1] (new unique element found):
▪ Store it at nums[j]
▪ Increment j
3 . Return j (number of unique elements).
