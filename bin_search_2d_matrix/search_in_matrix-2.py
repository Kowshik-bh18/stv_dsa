# This is called stair-case search 
'''
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 
Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false

As we are starting from the cell (0, m-1), the two variables i.e. ‘row’ and ‘col’ will point to 0 and m-1 respectively.
We will do the following steps until row < n and col >= 0(i.e. while(row < n && col >= 0)):
If matrix[row][col] == target: We have found the target and so we will return true.
If matrix[row][col] > target: We need the smaller elements to reach the target. But the column is in increasing order and so it contains only greater elements. So, we will eliminate the column by decreasing the current column value by 1(i.e. col--) and thus we will move row-wise.
If matrix[row][col] < target: In this case, We need the bigger elements to reach the target. But the row is in decreasing order and so it contains only smaller elements. So, we will eliminate the row by increasing the current row value by 1(i.e. row++) and thus we will move column-wise.
If we are outside the loop without getting any matching element, we will return false.
